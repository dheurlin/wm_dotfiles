# WM Configuration files

This repo contains files related to window managers (i3, bspwm) and related
programs (program launcher, status bar etc.)

The file structure in the repo is meant to mirror the files structure in my home
folder, e.g. everything in the `config` folder should go in `$HOME/.config` on
my computer.
